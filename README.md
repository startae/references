## Who is Ivan?

Have you ever heard someone saying "POOOORRA IVAN"? Or have you ever been called Ivan, even though that's not your name?
And after that, have you ever looked around the office for any Ivan and could not found anyone with that name?

Find more about Ivan [here](https://youtu.be/cPbl26Fw-dk).

## Oh no!

Once upon a time, Rafael and Victoria were starting a new project.
They were supposed to redesign the experience for a coaching platform and were watching screencasts to better understand how the system worked.
As the lady explained how to add and edit participants little did she notice that the edit button was right next to the delete trash bin.
She then accidentally clicked the delete icon and, since there was no alert, deleted a real participant from the platform.
Losing her composure and yelling "OOOOH NO!!!"

## Beautiful

Don't ever say this word at the office
EVER. NEVER EVER.

You probably want to say it, don't you?
You have probably already have said it, didn't you?

And you have probably heard someone singing ["beautiful"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FE194VN6c4) in a highly picthed voice.
We actually don't know how this started but that will happen EVERY TIME you say that word.

## WTFriday

You went to Slack and found the weirdest gifs ever? Probably, it's wtfriday: you wake up, drink your coffe and contribute with the craziest gif you can find.
